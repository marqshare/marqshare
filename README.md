Apparently tables in Markdown do not convert while within <p></p>. Noted.
SO, I make a table in HTML. Easy, right?!!!
-->
<table align="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Current Project(s)</th>
      <th>Completed Project(s)</th>
      <th>New Skill(s)</th>
      <th>Refined Skill(s)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[Insert Here]</td>
      <td>[Insert Here]</td>
      <td>[Insert Here]</td>
      <td>[Insert Here]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
